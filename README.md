# Data quality assessment

## Report data quality issues

This repository is used to [report issues/ask questions](https://github.com/enram/data-repository/issues) regarding:
- **Vertical profile data** derived from European weather radars, made available at <https://aloftdata.eu/browse/>
- **Metadata about European weather radars**, made available at <https://aloftdata.eu/radars/>

These issues are monitored by members of the radar aeroecology community, initially through the projects [ENRAM](https://www.enram.eu/) and [GloBAM](https://globam.science/). Note that we don't have the capacity or access rights to solve many of the reported issues. We mainly want to document them for interested users. Click the `Watch` button to be notified of new issues.

An overview of data quality assessments can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/enram/data-repository/wiki). Issues can be reported [here](https://github.com/enram/data-repository/issues).

## Legacy code

See the release [enram-data-repo](https://github.com/enram/data-repository/releases/tag/enram-data-repo) for code (website and data transfer functions) originally maintained in this repository.
